            Birla Mandir
<br>Located atop 280-foot-high hillock of Kalapahad, the beautiful Birla Mandir has derived its name from the industrialist Birlas who have constructed Birla temples in various parts of the country.

Constructed in 1976, it is said it took close to 2000 tonnes of white marbles to build this stunning temple which was brought from Rajasthan. It has drawn its architecture from the amalgamation of three known architectural designs - South Indian Architecture, Utkal temple Architecture and Rajasthani Architecture.

The temple has 11 ft. tall statue of Lord Lakshminarayana with a magnificent lotus carved around it. It also has separate shrines for deities such as Venkateswara, 'Padmavati' and 'Andal' as well. The complex also houses a separate temple of Lord Bhudda.
